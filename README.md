# 🧭 Path Finder Visualizer (Python)

A Python-based pathfinding algorithm visualizer built using `pygame`. This tool graphically demonstrates how popular pathfinding algorithms work in real time, helping you understand how they explore and find the shortest path from start to goal.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Visualizes algorithms like:
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  - A* Search
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
- 🟩 Click to place Start and End nodes
- 🧱 Draw and erase barriers with the mouse
- 📡 Real-time visualization of visited nodes and path
- ⏹️ Pause/Reset functionality
- 🐍 Built entirely in Python using `pygame`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- `pygame` for rendering and UI interaction

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pygame


💻 How to Run
1. git clone https://github.com/your-username/path_finder.git
cd path_finder
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python path_finder.py


🎮 Controls & Instructions
Action	Mouse / Keyboard
Set Start Node	Left-click on grid
Set End Node	Left-click on another grid cell
Draw Barriers (Walls)	Left-click and drag
Erase Node	Right-click
Start Algorithm	Press SPACE
Clear Grid	Press C

The algorithm will animate its process of visiting nodes and finding the shortest path.
